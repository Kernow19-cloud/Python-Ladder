# # PythonLadder

Welcome to **PythonLadder**! I have built this Python project to showcase my journey from beginner-friendly scripts to advanced applications. Whether youâ€™re here to explore my growth as a developer or assess my technical skills, I am excited to share this with you.

## What I have Created
- **Beginner**: Simple scripts like calculators and basic file handlers to lay the foundation.
- **Intermediate**: Practical tools, including data processing and API integrations.
- **Advanced**: Complex solutions like object-oriented designs, multithreading, and machine learning demos.

## How to Get Started
I have made it easy to dive in:
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PythonLadder.git`
2. Navigate to the directory: `cd PythonLadder`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Try a sample: `python beginner/calculator.py`

## How To Use It
Run `python intermediate/data_fetcher.py` to see us pull data from an API, or check out `advanced/ml_model.py` for a taste of our machine learning work. I have organized everything to reflect my progression.
